// for watch and continue the ts compile works
    ** tsc app.ts --w **

// to insilize the tsc configure file 
    **tsc --init**
// and in terminal write
    **tsc** --> this one comples all the ts files


TS - CONFIGUREATION
1.exclude --> array inside files are not compiled
1. include --> array inside files only compiled

        <--- COMPLIER OPTIONS ---->
1.target = "es6"
2.lib["dom","es6","dom.iterable","scripthost"]  // default set of target already

3.sourceMap = true  // its helps the debug
4.outDir="./dist"  --> inside this folder all compiled js files are stored
5.rootDir = "./src" --> inside this folder only ts files are going to compile
6.removeComments = true ---> remove the commets in compile js file 
7.noEmitOnError: true  // this feature doesn't allows to create js files if ts file as an noEmitOnError

// code quality OPTIONS
8.noUnusedLocals:true   // avoid un used varibles
9.noUnusedParameters:true  // avoid un use params
10.noImplicitReturns:true   // return all type condition


        <------- Class and inheritance module --------->
1.Object oriented programing (OOP)
    - Work with (real-life)Entities in your code
        - ShopingList,Product,ShopingCart 

-private  and public key word in class
- readonly key word it not alow the chage the feild

-private key assigned variable not acces outside the class and not acess the exceds class
-protected key unlike private we can acces any where in inheritance class but not outside class
- static property not acces inside the class methodes & it can acces without using of new key word

//private constructor
use the static methode and here we not use new keyword
1.what is abstract class
2.what is private and public
3.what is idea behond singleton class  // you only ever have one instance of a singleton class
4.what is static methode
5.what is the idea bheaind 'inheritance' //it allows to share some common functionalities and yet create more specialized blueprints


    <-----------------------Interface ---------------------->
interface keyword only exits in typeScirpt not in js
it allows as Object structure
Interfaces describe objects (or function types) but can't store/ describe arbitrary types like union types.

class "implements" Interface1,Interface2 so on  // for class given like this

6.what is difference interface and classes 
    -Interfaces are a pure TS feature and can't be instantiated

    <--------------------Advance Types -------------------->
1)INTERSECTION Types.
2)TYPE GUARDS
3)DISCRIMINATED UNIONS
4)TYPE CASTING
5)Optional chaining ?
6)


7.what is type GUARD?
    -With type guards you avoid runtime errors by checking types before you try to do something with the values.
ex:
function size(input: string | number) {
  if (typeof input === 'string') {
    return input.length;
  }
  return input;
}

8.in Which casses type casting helpfull?
    -You want to inform TS that a certain value is of a specific type.
